# ScreenShots :

# Updates Needed :
 1. Marker gets too much focued when used on android with 4.7 inch screee , but perfect for 5 or 5.5 inch .
 2. Many Places givs website and url and phone number as null . Need to add filter for that.
 3. Autocomplete Places to use full screen.
 4. As soon as back button is used when user is giving input in the application , result too disappear.
 5. Need to add a navigation button between the user input place activity and the map activity.
